Emts are independed, strong creatures, who live in colonies. Every Emt strives to keep the colony thriving, and does so by performing a stunningly uninteresting set of actions. All Emts can:

	- Explore or follow a trail of pheromones (chemicals) left by other Emts
	- Walk back to their colony
	- Pick up small enough objects and drop them, food or otherwise
	- Reproduce (don't sounds much like ants no more eh buddy)
	- Die (whoops)

Some Emts can also:
	
	- Fight other organisms
